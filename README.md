# Number-Recognition

A Number recognition project is a machine learning or computer vision endeavor focused on developing algorithms and models to automatically recognize and classify numeric characters (0-9) in various data sources, including images, scanned documents, or handwritten text. These projects typically involve data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the training of classification models. The main objective is to accurately and efficiently identify numbers within the given data, making it useful in applications like automated document processing, digit recognition in forms, or reading handwritten numbers. The project may encompass different techniques, from traditional image processing to more advanced deep learning approaches, to achieve accurate and robust number recognition.
